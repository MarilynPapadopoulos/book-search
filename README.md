# Book Search Engine

## Description 

This app allows the user to search for and save books when they are logged in.

Working with starter code, I transformed this app from api routes to graphql.  The previous code is comment out as to make the comparison between the old and the new.   

## Installation

The server and client run concurrently.  From the command line you can npm run develop.  Also to run the client and server separately you can npm start or npm run watch respectively.

## Usage
